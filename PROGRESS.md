## Log

### /exoplanet-postcard/ — Postcard from an Exoplanet

**Built.** Postcard that flips. Front is a generated illustrated scene (same layered sky/ridge technique as the almanac rework — light at the horizon, bands darkening forward); back is a message, correspondent and weather report. Eight world types (ocean, desert, ice, greenhouse, volcanic, ringed, storm, tidally locked).

**Judgment calls:** Names are catalogue-style inventions (`Brindle-253c`, `Alpha Kestrel IV`) rather than anything resembling a real exoplanet designation or a franchise world, so nothing collides with a real system. Gravity/day/year figures are randomised within plausible ranges and are clearly framed as invented — the footer says no real catalogue is quoted, since these are *not* sourced numbers.

**Verified:** 60 runs, 57 distinct names, 23 distinct greetings, 0 defects; scene renders 3+ land bands every time; flip works both ways.

### /morse/ — Morse Key

**Built.** Text in, Morse out: a live code strip, a blinking lamp, and a Web Audio tone. Speed slider is 5-30 wpm.

**Judgment calls:** Timing follows the real standard rather than an approximation — one dot is the unit, a dash is 3, letter gap 3, word gap 7, and a unit is 1200/wpm ms. That means the wpm number on the slider is honest. Verified with the standard word PARIS: it measures 43 units, which is exactly the canonical 50 minus the trailing word gap. Characters outside the standard alphabet (e.g. `#`) are shown struck through as unsendable rather than silently dropped — quietly discarding them would misrepresent what was sent.

**Verified:** SOS = `... --- ...`, HELLO WORLD correct letter for letter, unknown char flagged, lamp lights during send, playback stops cleanly and on tab-hide.

### /emoji-mistranslate/ — The Literalist

**Built.** Sentence in, deliberately over-literal emoji out, plus a read-back in plain English and a `where it went wrong` list.

**How it fails on purpose:** 43 idioms matched longest-first (so `hit the hay` beats `hit`), ~180 single words, and a homophone table that swaps *to/two*, *be/bee*, *see/sea*, *know/no*, *can/tin can*, *will/scroll* without checking context. Words with no symbol are kept as small grey text rather than dropped, so you can see what it refused to translate.

**Judgment call:** the read-back is the real payload — emoji alone is just noise, but `i'm going two assault some dried grass` shows the machine's reasoning. Hovering any symbol shows the word it came from.

**Verified:** idiom, homophone, no-match and empty-input paths all correct; fixed a bug where the notes list kept the previous sentence's entries.

### /fortune-cookie/ — The Fortune Cookie

**Built.** A drawn cookie that splits into two halves with scattering crumbs, revealing a paper slip: one fortune, six lucky numbers, one thing to learn. 52 fortunes.

**Judgment calls:** all 52 are written for this cabinet rather than collected — a fortune is short enough that borrowing one would be the entire toy. The register aims at the real thing (flat, confident, faintly ominous) without being advice, and the footer says plainly that a cookie knows nothing about your week. Lucky numbers are drawn 1-49 without repeats and sorted, so they look like a real ticket.

**Verified:** cracks on click and on the button, 10 crumbs animate, 29 distinct fortunes in 40 pulls, numbers unique/in-range/sorted. Fixed: the halves originally slid only 58px and ended up hidden behind the slip — they now fan clear of it on both sides.
